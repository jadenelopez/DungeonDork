                    <p class="mb-4">Henry Ghoon lived in the village of Villlador that was so small, it wasent even marked on the map. Villador was all Henry knew as he had never been outside of its walls. Because of this Henry was always very curious and interested in the other lands and regions such as the the shadow realm. At the age of 20, His village was attacked by demons. Almost all of his village was gone and along with it all of what he once knew was lost in an instant. Henry was one of 5 survivors from the demons attack. The 5 boys made a band to take revenge on the demons who took their home and 1 year they moved from place to place looking for leads on how to get to the demon world. they met an old wizard who agreed to cast a portal to the demon world on one condition, that the boys never mention this to anyone under any circumstances. The wizard opened the portal but it was only wide enough for one person. Henry went through first, and when he came through he saw the most grotesque, unimaginable sight anyone could ever see. Humans were never suppost to know about the demon world let along see it with their own eyes because of how hideous and confusing it can be for a human to wrap their mind around. Immediately Henry locked eyes with a demon who saw him come through and initiated a battle by drawing its massive flaming sword. Henry did not stand a chance so he ran for the portal, but before he could go through, his arm from the forearm down was cut clean off by the demons enchanted blade. Henry crashed back through the portal and black out. When Henry woke up, there was blood everywhere. All 4 of his friends from the village lay dead on the ground, along with the wizard who helped them out. Henry wasent the same as before though. His body was split in half, a demon side and a human side. Covered in a black and purple undying flame the demon had used on him, his right eye was black and red, blood shot entirely. Scars covered the right side of his chest and shoulder down to his severed arm. His teeth were sharp and jagged. Henry's goal seemed impossible now, how could he defeat such powerful opponents? And then it hit him. Use this power against them.</p>

                    <p>For the next few years Henry survived by taking body guard and assassination contracts from kingdoms that would take him. Covering up his appearance with dressings. He was good at what he did, but it was always a gamble what the outcome would be. He was precise and swift with his kills. But his demon powers could trigger and become a ruthless almost inhuman machine. Henry was both feared and looked up to for his kill record and contracts in the rogue community, with people hiring him for his precise and swift execution, and fearing his powerful demon side. With time, he managed to keep the demon mode in check and only used it in life and death situations. Henry used taught himself for a few years how to use stealth and his demon mode, until one fateful day, when he received a letter to board a train to BlackMount (see World page)...</p>
